Hey! I am Marc-Alexandre Montpas, welcome to my place. :)

I currently work as a Vulnerability Researcher, leading the Vulnerability Research Team at Sucuri (a GoDaddy company). My interests are diverse, going from Web Application Security and Reverse Engineering all the way to OS Design and Implementation. You'll generally find me hacking stuffs at Security CTFs (Capture The Flag) or disclosing vulnerabilities in popular products for fun.

## Social?
I _try_ to. You can reach me on Twitter [@marcS0H](@https://twitter.com/marcs0h). You can also find me blogging here or on [Sucuri's awesome blog](https://blog.sucuri.net/author/marc).

## Disclaimer
Just the usual stuff, the ideas and opinions presented here are my own and does not represent those of people, institutions and organizations that I may be associated with (unless explicitly stated).
